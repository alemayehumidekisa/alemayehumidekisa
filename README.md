I am Alemayehu Midekisa. I am  a research scientist at the University of Alabama. I am a former NASA Earth and Space Science fellow. My research interests include remote sensing, big data and environmental change. More specifically, I am interested in applying big geospatial data, cloud computing and machine learning to solve complex environmental problems, especially land cover change, climate change, water resource, agriculture, and public health. More information about my research  and teaching can be found at https://spatialelearning.com.
